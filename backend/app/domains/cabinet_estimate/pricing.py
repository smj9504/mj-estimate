# Per-LF base rates by tier (supply only, before labor multiplier)
# Validated against real DMV contractor quotes (2025-2026)
# 2026-08 update: tiered increase reflecting Section 232 cabinet tariffs
# (25% on imports, effective 2025-10-14) plus manufacturer list-price
# increases (2.7%-5.5% avg, effective Feb-Mar 2026). Stock/RTA lines have
# the highest import exposure (Vietnam/China), Custom is mostly
# domestic-built and only sees lumber-tariff/labor pass-through.
# Stock +5%, Semi-Custom +3%, Custom +1%.
#
# 2026-08-26 follow-up increase (user feedback: base prices still low vs.
# market even after the 2026-08-25 tariff-exposure pass). Fresh research:
# Section 232 cabinet tariffs stable at 25% through 2026/2027 (planned
# escalation delayed — no new tariff spike). But DMV market comparison
# shows real gaps: Stock $284/LF already near top of $100-300 market
# range (small bump only); Semi-Custom $414/LF sits mid a wide $150-650
# range (meaningful room); Custom $676/LF sits low-mid its $500-1200+
# range (biggest gap, plus mild lumber-tariff pressure on domestic-built
# tier). Tier-differentiated: Stock +5-8%, Semi-Custom +12-16%,
# Custom +15-20%, applied across BASE_RATES/TALL_CABINET_TYPES/
# GLASS_DOOR_PREMIUM/island & prefab pricing/crown molding. Ancillary
# SCOPE_ITEMS/backsplash/appliance R&R (never adjusted before) get a
# flat +8-12% catch-up. Countertop pricing left untouched — already
# matches 2026 market ($50-150/SF quartz, $40-175/SF granite).
#
# 2026-09-18 (v1): wall_lf ratios trimmed to ~0.80-0.82 of base.
#
# 2026-09-18 (v2): REVISED against a 403-SKU real price matrix (Kitchen
# Cabinet Depot, White Painted Shaker RTA, single door style/finish so
# the ratios are clean). Two of the v1 calls were wrong:
#
#  * wall:base measured 0.706 (W3030 $395.77 / B30S $560.42) and 0.72 at
#    24". v1 set 0.80-0.82 reasoning from a published 0.70-0.85 band and
#    picking the top "because DMV runs high" - but DMV affects LABOR, not
#    the factory box ratio (see the BLS check in the v2 report: DMV trade
#    wages are only +3-12% over national). Moved to the measured 0.71.
#
#  * tall_each was LEFT ALONE in v1 on the reasoning that a pantry is one
#    tall box, not a base+wall stack. The measured data says the box is
#    far more expensive than either model assumed:
#        U248424 (24x84 pantry) $1,080.85 = 2.34x B24 ($462.22)
#        ... and 1.36x a B24 + W2430 stack.
#    v1's $539 implies only 1.35x the Stock B24 equivalent ($400), i.e.
#    the rate was ~74% below the measured ratio.
#    Raised to the MIDPOINT of current-vs-measured (+39%) rather than
#    straight to 2.34x: the SKU matrix is RTA catalog list pricing, which
#    sits above what a contractor actually pays, so going all the way to
#    the measured ratio would over-correct. Revisit against a real
#    supplier quote - see the v2 report Â§F.

#
# 2026-09-18 rebuild. The old table was labelled "Xactimate RCV" but had
# drifted badly out of line with the D&R line items it claimed to follow,
# and the internal ordering had inverted: a dishwasher ($449) priced 2.7x a
# wall oven ($167), and a disposer ($305) matched a gas range ($307).
# Neither is defensible on any price list — a wall oven is a two-person
# lift out of a cabinet opening with a hardwired connection, a disposer is
# a 20-minute twist-off.
#
# Rebuilt against Xactimate D&R line items (detach and reset the EXISTING
# unit - crew time only, no new appliance, no haul-off):
#   DWRS   Dishwasher - Detach & reset          $271.88 (NJ 2021)
#   OVBIRS Oven, built-in - Detach & reset      ~$242
#   RGGRS  Range, gas - Detach & reset          ~$186
#   MWSRS  Microwave, built-in - Detach & reset ~$141
#   HDRS   Range hood - Detach & reset          ~$105
#   RHRS   Range hood, wood - Detach & reset    ~$284
#   Remove Garbage disposer                     $42.33
# DMV labor sits above the NJ 2021 book, so these carry a regional uplift
# rather than copying the published figures outright. What matters is that
# the ORDER is now right: oven > dishwasher > range > microwave > hood,
# and the disposer is the cheapest line on the table.
#
# NOTE: this is Detach & Reset — reusing the customer's own appliance.
# Replacing a unit (new appliance + haul-off) is a different scope and is
# not priced here; quote the appliance separately if that is the job.
#
# ── Which basis this table uses (settled 2026-09-18, v2) ──
# The v2 review compared this table against two different bases and found
# it "too high on one, too low on the other". The basis is deliberately
# Xactimate D&R, because this estimator is claim-linked and the UI calls
# the scope "Detach & Reset" throughout.
#
# Two cautions when re-checking these numbers against a price list:
#
#  * Xactimate publishes DETACH-ONLY line items (e.g. "Dishwasher -
#    Detach" $96.78) alongside DETACH & RESET ones (DWRS $271.88).
#    Detach-only is half the job. Comparing this table to a detach-only
#    figure will always make it look 2-4x "too expensive" - that is the
#    comparison being wrong, not the price.
#
#  * Retail appliance-installer price lists carry a MINIMUM TRIP CHARGE
#    (~$245) on every unit. That is right for a homeowner installing one
#    appliance, but a kitchen reset moves 4-6 appliances on a single
#    visit, so applying a per-unit trip charge would bill the same trip
#    five times. If this estimator ever needs the retail basis, the trip
#    has to be pulled out into one shared line.
#
# Against the D&R benchmark the table now runs a consistent 1.16-1.28x
# (DMV labor uplift over the NJ-2021 published book).
# The table itself is GENERATED, not hand-written. See
# appliance_labor.py: retail pricing is derived from crew hours, and
# carrier pricing is mapped from the published Xactimate line items.
# Hand-editing individual prices is what produced the inversions this
# replaced (a dishwasher reset at 2.7x a wall oven), so edit the hours
# or the published figures instead.
#
# This name is kept, and defaults to the insurance basis, so existing
# callers keep working. Prefer appliance_table(basis) in new code.

# ── Material / labor split ──
# Share of a line item that is NON-LABOR cost - material, equipment, and hard
# fees. The remainder is crew time. Lines whose rate table already separates
# supply from install (hardware, crown molding, island panels, backsplash,
# plumbing) derive their own share from the real components and ignore this
# table; the values here are for rates quoted as a single supply-and-install
# number, so they are working assumptions. Adjust them here if they do not

# is already inside the material rates). It is intentionally NOT added:
# sales tax must never appear on the customer-facing cabinet PDF.
#
# The MD/VA half of that recommendation is already satisfied — BASE_RATES
# and the other material rates are quoted on a contractor-supply basis,
# which has the tax baked in. Do not add a separate tax line, a tax_rate
# field, or a tax row in export_service.py. If the DC rate change ever
# needs to be reflected, raise the material rates rather than itemizing
