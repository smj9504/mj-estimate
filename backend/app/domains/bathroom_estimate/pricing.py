Bathroom Remodel Estimate pricing constants for DMV area.
All rates based on 2025-2026 web research:
- Fixr.com, Angi, HomeAdvisor, HomeGuide, HomeWyse, This Old House
- Boss Design Center (DC Metro specific)
- DMV Fix Remodeling (Columbia MD area)
- Modernize, InchCalculator, CountBricks

Rates are mid-range for the DMV region (DC/MD/VA).
Includes material + labor unless otherwise noted.

2026-08 price update (research: FloorDaily Ceramic Tile Report 2026,
CountBricks labor rates Feb 2026, Depo Homes "Bathroom Remodel Costs
Increase 15-20% in 2026", felixdeco tariff tracker):
- Import tariffs are pushing tile and vanity/cabinet costs up sharply
  (tile ceramic ~+15%, vanity tariff exposure ~20-28%) — categories most
  exposed to tariffs capped at the top of our 1-5% adjustment range.
  TARIFF BASIS CORRECTED 2026-09-18: the original note cited "Section
  301+122". IEEPA-based tariffs were struck down by the Supreme Court in
  Feb 2026, so that basis is partly void. Still in force: Section 232
  (vanity/kitchen cabinets 25%, effective 2025-10-14; a 50% increase is
  deferred to at least 2027) and Section 301 (Chinese furniture +25%,
  unaffected by the ruling). Ceramic tile: India countervailing 3.0-3.5%,
  China anti-dumping 104-400%.
- Skilled trade labor (plumber/electrician) up ~8-10% YoY on tight
  labor supply — plumbing/electrical nudged up accordingly.
- Fixtures (toilets, sinks, tub/shower units) showed milder +2-3%
  supplier increases.
- Paint, trim, demo/disposal remained comparatively stable (+1-2%).
Applied per-category: tile/substrate/vanity +5%, plumbing/electrical
+3-4%, fixtures/tub/shower +2-3%, paint/trim/accessories/demo +1-2%,
rounded to natural price points.

2026-08-26 follow-up increase (user feedback: base prices still low vs.
market after the 2026-08-25 pass). Fresh research: HomeWyse May 2026 —
bathroom ceramic tile install $17.22-$21.37/SF all-in (already matched
by our porcelain floor combo ~$18.35/SF); DC toilet-install labor
benchmark $200-$300 (already matched/exceeded by our $365); bathroom
vanity install labor $576-$871 (our $499 was well below range).
Applied tiered: pure labor/install line items +15-20% (vanity install,
electrical fixture installs, bathtub/shower/sink/mirror install labor,
Detach & Reset costs), items already near market +5-8% (tile combo
rates, plumbing fixture-connection labor, demo, paint/trim, materials).

# Cost basis classes (§0-1-1) — what handling applies to
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────
# Rates in this file come from three different KINDS of source. Handling is
# decided by the SOURCE KIND, not by which section a rate happens to live in:
#
#   SKU  — retail listing price (Home Depot, DreamLine, Aquatic, Fab Glass…).
#          Over-the-counter, so it carries NO sourcing, pickup/delivery,
#          storage, staging or return/damage-risk allowance.
#          -> x MATERIAL_HANDLING, then x O&P  (total ≈ 1.39)
#   INST — installed benchmark (HomeWyse, Angi…). The installing trade's
#          burden and handling are already inside the number.
#          -> O&P only  (total ≈ 1.21)
#   PASS — pass-through (dumpster, permit, inspection). No markup at all.
#
# Sanity check: SKU material at 1.39 sits inside the 25-50% material markup
# range trade sources quote for residential remodeling; INST at 1.21 is the
# top of HomeWyse's own 13-22% GC markup guidance. Both are defensible.
#
# NOTE: an earlier revision listed the SKU scope as five section numbers
# ("§7 · §8 · §6-1 · §10-1 · §11-3"). That shorthand silently dropped §5-1
# tile material, §8-1 prefab shower units, §9-1/9-3/9-4 shower components,
# §10-4 faucets and §11-1/11-2 sink & mirror material. The authoritative
# scope is the source kind — see SKU_PRICED_TABLES below.

# O&P (optional)

# Applied COMPOUND: cost x 1.10 x 1.10 = x1.21 (see calculator.py).
#
# This is NOT double-counting margin. Construction estimating separates three
# layers and each is charged exactly once:
#   L1 trade unit price  — material + burdened labor (insurance, benefits,
#                          payroll tax). This is what the rates in this file
#                          are, and what HomeWyse publishes.
#   L2 job overhead      — dumpster, portable toilet, protection, permits
#                          (GENERAL_CONDITIONS / permit allowance).
#   L3 general O&P       — the GC's office, management and profit. THIS.
#
# HomeWyse states its unit costs use "base wage + overhead costs (insurance,
# benefits)" — i.e. L1 only — and explicitly instructs adding 13-22% on top
# when a general contractor manages the job. RSMeans likewise treats its
# "Total Incl. O&P" as the *installing subcontractor's* O&P and expects GC
# General Conditions (5-15%, typically 10%) above that. Xactimate separates
# job-personnel, job-related and general overhead the same way.
#
# x1.21 therefore sits at the TOP of HomeWyse's recommended 13-22% band —
# defensible, but do not stack further markup on top of it. Cutting it to
# 6+6 (12.4%) would fall BELOW the recommended floor and under-recover.
