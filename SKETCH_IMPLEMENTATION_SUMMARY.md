# Interior Sketch System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have designed and implemented a comprehensive backend system for the interior sketch functionality in the MJ React App. The implementation follows the existing Domain-Driven Design patterns and provides a complete data model, API layer, and business logic for managing interior sketches with full integration to the existing estimate/invoice systems.
